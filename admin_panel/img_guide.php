<p class="smalldarkgrey">Since this site uses PHP as a fronthand language and MySQL as backhand Database server, So here are the few options and limitations before uploading your image file.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="smallnavy">PHP supports not more than 2 MB of files to be uploaded and the time limit is 30 secs &plusmn; 15 secs. If the file size is more than 2 MB or it takes more than 30 secs to upload, the server may not respond or script may generate errors. This is Universal from Past to Now for the securtiy reasons. </li>
  <li class="smallred">There are two kind of images that are uploaded from the admin panel. The first one is the thumbnail picture (small view) which is of size 
  

   130 x 98 px. Also we have the enlarged picture of the thumbnail view which can be of any size.</li>
